## Detailed Explanation of the Workflow

1. **Define Objectives**:
   - Netlists are colleceted to train machine learning mdels to perform floorplanning.
   - !! Specify key variables and data types required for the analysis.

2. **Source Identification**:
   - Determine the sources of data (e.g., surveys, APIs, sensors).
   - Explain the rationale for choosing these sources.

3. **Data Collection**:
   - Tools and technologies used (e.g., Python scripts for scraping, manual surveys, IoT sensors).
   - Sampling methods or criteria for data selection.
   - Timeline of data collection.

4. **Preprocessing**:
   - Initial steps for cleaning raw data (e.g., removing duplicates, handling missing values).
   - Software used (e.g., pandas in Python, Excel).

5. **Data Validation**:
   - Methods for ensuring accuracy and consistency in the collected data.
   - Any statistical checks or verification processes.

## File Formats
The dataset is provided in widely accepted, non-proprietary formats:
- **CSV**: For structured data.
- **JSON**: For hierarchical or relational data structures.

Each format ensures compatibility with various analysis tools and programming languages.
